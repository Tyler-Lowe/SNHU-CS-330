How Do I Approach Designing Software?
Designing software starts with understanding the requirements and breaking them into smaller, manageable tasks. For this project, I began by visualizing the 3D scene I wanted to create and identifying the basic shapes and textures needed.

New Design Skills Developed
Transformational Thinking: My work on this project taught me how to transform real-world objects into 3D representations using basic shapes and transformations.
Layered Design: I learned to combine multiple shapes to create more complex objects and how to place them in a visually compelling way within the 3D space.
Design Process Followed
Ideation: Chose the objects and visualized their placement in the scene.
Breakdown: Identified which shapes and textures were needed.
Implementation: Applied transformations like scaling, rotation, and translation to accurately position objects.
Refinement: Iteratively adjusted positions and textures for a polished look.
Future Applications
The tactics of breaking down complex tasks, leveraging transformations, and layering designs can be applied to a wide range of software design challenges, from game development to user interface design.

How Do I Approach Developing Programs?
My development approach involves creating modular code and incrementally building functionality while testing at each step. For this project, I started with setting up basic shapes and then added features like textures, lighting, and interactivity.

New Development Strategies
Iterative Refinement: Debugging and refining code incrementally improved my results.
Reusable Code: Writing modular functions made it easier to test and reuse components for different objects in the scene.
Role of Iteration
Iteration was crucial for refining object placement, textures, and lighting. It allowed me to identify and fix errors while improving the overall quality of the scene.

Evolution of Development Approach
Throughout the milestones, I became more efficient in debugging and more creative in applying textures and lighting effects. My confidence in managing 3D graphics programming improved significantly.

How Can Computer Science Help Me Reach My Goals?
Educational Pathway
Learning computational graphics has broadened my understanding of how real-world visuals are created. These skills will support future coursework, especially in areas like game development and virtual reality.

Professional Pathway
The ability to work with computational graphics opens doors to industries like gaming, animation, and software development. Skills in OpenGL and 3D visualization are directly applicable to creating simulations, designing user interfaces, and developing immersive experiences.

This project has been a valuable learning experience, giving me both the technical skills and confidence to approach more advanced projects in the future. The combination of design, development, and computational graphics has been both challenging and rewarding.
